Functions to change:

utils.sort_to_snake():
	
	Add an if statement for the new plate type, and define how you want the wells to be sorted.
	If snake sorting is fine, code can be copied from the other blocks and have the values changed 
	for the proper number of rows and columns.
	

imager_controls.autocorrect():
	
	This function is currently designed for circular wells, and should work with any variation.
	However, different shaped wells will require an additional if statement checking the plate type,
	and the appropraite CV logic to enact autocorrect on this shape.
	
	
application.open_custom_window():

	This whole window must be redefined to match the new plate format. The same code can be used,
	but copied into an if block with changed row and column values.
	
	
application.determine_wells():

	This function reads user inputs on the toggle boxes to determine which wells to include in a run.
	New boxes will need to be added and evaluated to match the plate's format.
	
	
application.determine_custom_wells():

	Currently loops through a hardcoded 288 iterations. This value should be changed, along with the
	length of the variable list, to account for the total number of wells on a new plate.
	
	
application.determine_coordinates():

	Determines the locations of all wells by using the location of the first well. Must add an if 
	statement for the new plate type, and add in math for determining distance between wells. This 
	information can usually be found on the data sheets provided by the manufacturer.\
	
	
application.paint_custom_diagram():

	Similar to open_custom_window(), this section must be redefined for the target plate format.
	well_to_coordinates() and well_to_little_coordinates() should also be updated accordingly.
	
	
application.go()

	Add an if statement to check the plate name and set the file extension accordingly.


imager_controls.run_auto_imager(), and all related auto_imaging functions (4 in total):

	Add an if statement for the new plate type, and copy the running information
	from the previous sections. Make any appropriate changes within this block, 
	such as using a	different variation of XY autocorrect or different starting locations.
